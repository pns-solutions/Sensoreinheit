// WhiteBox Labs -- Tentacle Shield -- I2C asynchronous example
// https://www.whiteboxes.ch/tentacle
//
//
// This code is intended to work on all Arduinos. If using the Arduino Yun, connect
// to it's serial port. If you want to work with the Yun wirelessly, check out the respective
// Yun version of this example.
// It will allow you to control up to 8 Atlas Scientific devices through the I2C bus.
//
// This example shows how to take readings from the sensors in an asynchronous way, completely
// without using any delays. This allows to do other things while waiting for the sensor data.
// To demonstrate the behaviour, we will blink a simple led in parallel to taking the readings.
// Notice how the led blinks at the desired frequency, not disturbed by the other tasks the
// Arduino is doing.
// 
//
// USAGE:
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// - Set all your EZO circuits to I2C before using this sketch.
//    - You can use the "tentacle-steup.ino" sketch to do so)
//    - Make sure each circuit has a unique I2C ID set
// - Change the variables TOTAL_CIRCUITS, channel_ids and channel_names to reflect your setup
// - Set host serial terminal to 9600 baud
